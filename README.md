# ES-Project-EdgeMatch

In this project we implemented and evaluated the scheduling algorithms described in the article "EdgeMatch: A Smart Approach for Scheduling IoT-Edge Tasks with Multiple Criteria using Game Theory." 

The approach presented in this paper is based on game theory and matching algorithms. It involves two main scheduling strategies: centralized and distributed. The centralized approach is designed for environments where a single entity has control over the scheduling decisions, whereas the distributed approach allows edge nodes and IoT devices to make independent scheduling decisions based on their preferences and constraints. Additionally, the research introduces a preference-based stable matching (PBSM) algorithm that ensures a fair and balanced allocation of resources while minimizing the execution time of IoT tasks.
